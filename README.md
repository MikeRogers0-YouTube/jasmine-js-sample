# Jasmine JS examples

We're going to mark a Blark object, and make it pass the tests we write about it.

##Â Libraries

 - https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine#installation / https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html

## Other things to look at

- https://github.com/mochajs/mocha - Similar, to jasmine
- https://qunitjs.com/ - Also similar to jasmine
- https://travis-ci.org/ - Eventually we'll setup this to run in CI, so when a PR is made we can verify it has not broken anything.
